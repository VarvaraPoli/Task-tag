# Component for creating tags
This is the component for creating tags, where we have a separate field with the addition of new tags in text form, button to add text from input to tags and the list of tags itself with a cross icon for the ability to remove a tag from list.

Functional:
getter-setter of state of the list of tags --
methods for getting a list of added tags,
setting a new list of tags instead of the previous one,
adding one tag through a method or deleting one tag via a method,
a method to set the readonly state when we will not be able to change something through the UI,
writing and reading a list of tags in localStorage,
create readonly mode when the ability to change tags is blocked
(add and remove), a method for
change this readonly state,
checkbox for displaying and changing this state all these changes are applied without reloading the page.

Done without frameworks and libraries after passing the basics of js training on the Udemy.com.
